# Clients Portfolio

Contacted by a client that wanted to create a simple online portfolio page with his information and showcase his work.
He attempted to use a template (reference on the footer of the page) but found several problems.

He wrote his info in the HTML along with some custom images.

His problems began when trying to change the style sheet, changing some layout, trying to make elements bigger, others smaller...

After an evening through discord and communication, to teach him how to do some of his problems and hardcoding other parts myself,<br>
**the desired result of the client was obtained**

Thanks to <a href="https://nisar.dev/">Nisar</a> for the template.
